# WishFund - Help Others to be Happy
<br/>
We made a two user interface one for the event organiser and another for a simple user who can be anyone above age 15.
<br/>
Event Organiser can book an event, request his event for crowd-funding, make blogs for his events so that the user can know about upcoming events. <br/>
The event organiser can also view volunteering requests from users. <br/>
<br/>The other user can view the blogs made by other users or event organisers, apply for volunteering and give funds for crowd-funding.
</br> Stacks used: ReactJS, DJango Rest Framework, Material UI.
